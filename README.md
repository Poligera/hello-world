# hello-world
Polina here, a pianist and teacher who has fallen in love with coding. I have started with Python in January 2021 and then siwtched to JavaScript.
This is my "Hello World" repository in preparation for my traineeship starting in June. I was so lucky to get a place and so I literally cannot wait!!
